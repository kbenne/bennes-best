# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

## Style Guidelines
- HTML: Semantic elements, accessibility attributes
- CSS: BEM naming convention preferred
- JS: Use vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks
- File structure: Keep CSS in css/, JS in js/, images in img/
- Error handling: Use try/catch for async operations
- Responsive design: Mobile-first approach with media queries
- Images: Use descriptive alt text and responsive techniques
- Keep code simple and maintainable over clever solutions
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
